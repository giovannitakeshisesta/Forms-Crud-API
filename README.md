# Only-forms-API
Is an example of a CRUD of the most common form inputs and their validations.

I used mostly Mongoose, Express, Axios, NodeJs, Javascript, React,React Hook Form, Yup.

The design is basic and simple,  so you can focus better on the code.

#
#### We have 3 forms with the following fields.

+ text, email, number, radio, text, area, check box
+ text, image
+ The last is the sum of the 2 forms.

They are separated in different files and views because the CRUD of an image needs a different way of manage the datas.
